# Spot the Difference

This question is asked by Google. You are given two strings, s and t which only consist of lowercase letters. t is generated by shuffling the letters in s as well as potentially adding an additional random character. Return the letter that was randomly added to t if it exists, otherwise, return ’ ‘.
Note: You may assume that at most one additional character can be added to t.


Ex: Given the following strings...

> s = "foobar", t = "barfoot", return 't'<br>
> s = "ide", t = "idea", return 'a'<br>
> s = "coding", t = "ingcod", return ''<br>
> s = "a", t = "aa", return 'a'<br>
> s = "abcd", t = "abcde", return 'e'
